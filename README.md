Project Proposal is an easy-to-use platform where students upload, view, and send
project proposals online. Teachers and supervisors can quickly review and respond,
while everyone can track progress in real-time. Plus, students get access to demo proposals
for inspiration. It’s all secure and organized, with separate sections for students,
supervisors, and department heads. Say goodbye to the hassle of paper proposals – our
system makes it smooth sailing for everyone involved!"
The Project Proposal Manager automates the submission and review of project proposals.
It allows students to create proposals, supervisors to review them, and heads of
departments to make final decisions. The system supports file uploads, real-time status
tracking, and integration with GitHub for project progress monitoring. It ensures
efficient management of project proposals from inception to approval.
